The title, authors, and cover art (including the blue hippo image) perfectly match the actual publication, strongly contradicting a common AI generation artifact.",

        "Key: The subject's facial expressions, lip movements (consistent with speech implied in Frame 1), and hand movements appear natural and fluid, without any robotic, jerky, or unnaturally smooth motions.",
        "Key: There are no detected AI generation artifacts such as blending issues at facial or body boundaries, lighting inconsistencies, temporal flickering, or warping in the background.",
        "Key: The subject's identity is highly consistent across all video frames and matches the provided reference photo closely, including facial features, hair, and a visible mole on the cheek.",
